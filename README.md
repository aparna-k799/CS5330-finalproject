# CS 5330 - Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision - Final Project


Group members: Aparna Krishnan, Farhan Sarfraz, Suparna Srinivasan

Project Description:   This is idea utilizes object detections of playing cards and making essentially a rough game of Blackjack. Where multiple cards will be on the frame, and we will detect each card and display their values, and when two cards overlap with their bounding boxes, we will have them add up their values, and then develop the game logic to make essentially (in theory) an online game of blackjack in real time, compared to programmed versions of the game.

Files submitted: detect.py, funcs.py, video.py, CardImgs directory, Project Report, README.md
